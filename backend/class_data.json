In addition to learning the factual information about how selected processes work in the legal and social context, students will be asked to consider the role they can play as citizens in supporting or changing these social processes. The course will take a particular interest in psycholegal issues \"in action\" and in learning about the clinical-legal processes used to determine the disposition of individuals considered marginal in society. Finally, the course will address the mechanisms that are used to exclude individuals from open society through criminal and civil court processes, the role of psychology as a science, and the role of psychologists as behavioral experts in criminal and civil courts, and in shaping social policies.","keywords":["psychology","science","law","social","policy","behavior"],"name":"Psychology, Law, and Social Policy","number":"PSYCH 401","requisites":[["PSYCH 202"]],"sections":[{"instructor":"Gregory Van Rybroek","location":"121 Brogden Psychology Building","subsections":[],"time":{"monday":"4:00pm - 5:15pm","wednesday":"4:00pm - 5:15pm"},"number":"LEC_001"}],"subject":"Psychology"},{"credits":3,"description":"Basic concepts of logic, sets, partial order and other relations, and functions.
